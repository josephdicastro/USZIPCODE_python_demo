    "This project investigates AirBNB housing prices by zipcode, using two data sources:\n",
    "1. A csv of NYC AirBNB listings found on Kaggle. This CSV lists the lat, lng of the individual AirBNB, but not the associated zipcode.\n",
    "2. A library call to the python USZIPCODE library that performs a geolookup from the AirBNB lat and lngs to get the associated zipcode.\n",
    "    - This library call retrieives an object that contains demographic data about the zipcode as well. \n",
    "    - The USZipCode library is continually updated with geolocation and demographic data. Documentation for this library can be found here: https://uszipcode.readthedocs.io/index.html\n",

    "1. The first step in the process was downloading the AirBNB dataset from Kaggle. \n",
    "2. We read this into a pandas dataframe. The resulting df contained 48,895 listings. \n",
    "3. We filtered that df to only include listings that had 25 or greater reviews. This gave us a dataset with 11617 listings. \n",
    "4. Once we had our base dataset, we needed to perform geocode lookups.\n",
    "    - The AirBNB dataset only had lat & lng coordinates.\n",
    "    - To get the associated zipcode, we wrote a function to perform a coordinate lookup from the AirBNB file to the USZIPCODE library, which returned a result set that included the zipcode and a number of demographic data associated with that zipcode. \n",
    "    - We stored the entire zipcode_object as a dictionary in a new column within each row, which gave us the complete zip and demographic data for each listing. \n",
    "    - We wrote another function to pull out particular bits of information from the entire zipcode result set\n",
    "        - zipcode\n",
    "        - Median Home Value \n",
    "        - Median Household Income \n",
    "    - We could pull out lots of other information if we wanted to expand our analysis. \n",
    "5. After we run both the zipcode_obj retrieval function and the individual key-value lookups, we stored the resulting dataframe in PostgreSQL \n",
    "6. Because the zipcode_obj was stored as a dictionary, we had to tell sql_alchemy to treat that column as a JSON datatype so that it could properly insert the column into Postgre."
