# USZIPCODE library demo of AirBNB Data

This project is a simple demo of using the USZIPCODE python library to geolookup zipcodes from a dataset of AirBNB rentals in NYC.
The dataset file provided lat/long coordinates for various AirBNB rentals, but it did not provide the associated zipcode. Using the USZIPCODE
library, I was able to grab the zipcodes of all rentals, as well as some assoicated demographic data for each of the codes. 

This is a work-in-progress project. The dataset has been finalized, but plots and final analysis have yet to be completed.
